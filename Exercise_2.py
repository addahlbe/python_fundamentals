## Exercise 2: Comments and Pound Characters
#A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
#Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print "I could have code like this." #and the comment after is ignored

#You can also use a comment to "disable" pr comment out a piece of code:
#print "This won't run."

print "This will run."
# this is called an octothorpe!
